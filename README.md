firedict
========

A simple offline dictionary software for Firefox OS and Firefox for Android

Currently, only StarDict dictionaries are supported. Users can organize many
dictionaries by renaming, coloring, reordering them and by classifying them in
groups. The last 20 terms that have been looked up are stored and can be accessed
directly from the start screen.

The user interface can be customized. Users can change the font size of dictionary
entries or force all dictionary colors to be greyscale. Furthermore, long entries
can be truncated by default.

translators are as follows:

* English, German - tuxor1337

* French - anonymous contributor

If you are interested in contributing to the localization of FireDict, have a
look at the localizable strings in `locales/firedict.en-US.properties` and feel
free to send a pull request.

testing the ui
--------------

Run `make testbuild` in order to get a version of this app that doesn't require
privileges and permissions. You can run the app `testbuild/index.html` in
any browser (mobile or non-mobile, offline or online) and test all the ui stuff
like i10n.js, AngularJS and stylesheets. (The test worker uses dummy
dictionaries and dummy lookups etc.)
