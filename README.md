testing the ui
--------------

Run `make testbuild` in order to get a version of this app that doesn't require
privileges and permissions. You can run the app `testbuild/index.html` in
any browser (mobile or non-mobile, offline or online) and test all the ui stuff
like i10n.js, AngularJS, jQuery and stylesheets. (The test worker uses dummy
dictionaries and dummy lookups etc.)
